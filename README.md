**What's inside**

- Client _it contains a fake client implementation for API_
- Components _all of our basic components are here_
- Context _mock to fake database or persistance method like cache or redux_
- Hooks _the core of the whole project, it contains the useContancts hooks that is the whole point of the project_
- Routes _nothing to say, it is just routes üòé_
- Theme _Chakra UI theme config, still managing ü§ì_
- ts _interface, type, enum and they are never enough üòç_
- Views _all of our pages_

The project contains two solutions of implementing the following functions: create a contact from a From.
The first one, you can follow by searching for **CreateContact**
The second one, you can follow by searching for **useContact**

**NOTE: to activate the solution of **useContact** just be sure to passe true to the import of useContacts in BankTransferOutcome**

##### Do you want a challenge?

Fork this project and try to implement a new view, with another form inside of it.
Then, try to create a contact from that form using both solutions ü•∏.
